# 📈 MSFT Stock Risk Classification & Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to classify and predict the **next-day risk level** of Microsoft (MSFT) stock using historical market data and machine learning models.

Risk classification is based on **Z-score analysis**, and multiple supervised ML models are trained and compared.

## 🏆 Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|------|---------|
| KNN | XX% |
| Decision Tree | XX% |
| SVM | XX% |
| Random Forest | **Best** |

> Random Forest performed best due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and reduce overfitting.
